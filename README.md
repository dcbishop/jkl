Under development, not yet functional...

Jkl (pronounced Jackal) is a text editor inspired by Vim. It is written in Go.

Planned features:
=================

* Allow a choice of Vim-like key mappings, emacs style chords and a simple editor.
* Support plugins written in Go by having the editor recompile itself.
* Both text-based and QML user interfaces.
* Possibly allow for a client/server model and allowing multiple users to edit the same file for pair programming.
